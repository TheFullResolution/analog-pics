  <h2><mat-icon>emoji_objects</mat-icon>Why?</h2>
  <p>
    I made it in the first version of this page in 2015. The goal was to extend
    my portfolio, learn Vue.js (1st version) and practice creating some
    real-life projects. Web development was only a hobby for me at the time, the
    page was just a simple frontend with no content management and no
    straightforward way to upload new pictures.
  </p>
  <p>
    Same as in 2015, this newer version served as a tool to explore the latest
    technologies and teach me new skills. This time I challenged myself to
    create a full web application with content management, database, and image
    hosting.

  <h2><mat-icon>format_paint</mat-icon>How?</h2>
  <p>
    In August 2018 I pushed the first commit to GitHub. I decided to use the
    newest Angular and Firebase, together with cloud functions.
  </p>
  <p>
    From the very beginning, RxJS was the biggest challenge as I had no
    experience with reactive programming. During this time, I often paused
    development to go through courses related to the stack I was using. By the
    end of 2018, I managed to complete the most challenging part – uploading
    pictures and then using cloud functions, resizing them, and storing them to
    the database.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the end of 2018, I switched jobs and in 2019 I focused on other
    technologies – GraphQL, NodeJS and C++, so the project was put back on the
    shelf. Beginning of 2020 I finished and polished the project, finally being
    able to mark it as feature complete.

  <h2><mat-icon>laptop</mat-icon>What?</h2>
  <p>
    This web app could be divided into three separate modules: frontend part,
    CMS part, and cloud functions.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Frontend Part</b> - the simplest possible gallery/image viewer. With
      some basic functionality. Made to be as small as possible and performant.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>CMS Part</b> - the advanced user interface to upload, remove and
      publish pictures. Lazy loaded with all the added packages like firebase.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Cloud Functions</b> - these handle the creation of thumbnails and
      putting information into the database. Additionally, there is a function
      which would serve the list of images to Frontend Part, so I do not have to
      use Firebase package to retrieve the images.
    </li>
  </ul>
